# Hanabi project

A python3 module that knows Hanabi:

* card deck and dealer
* CLI, verify that your moves are allowed
* GUI
* AI


## Tasks

This project is for 3 to 4 students:

* Aisha is in charge of the AI
* Cliona is in charge of the main module and command-line interface
* Guido is in charge of the GUI
* Electra is the free-electron: project manager, superviser, end-user, tester, debugger.


### Week 1

* Electra: fast-prototype the module's interface, keeping in mind the 3 use-cases: command-line, GUI and AI auto-play.
* Cliona: program a simple CLI (keep it simple).
* Aisha: read the article, design you own idea, summarize the algorithm(s). Write 1 or 2 algorithms (will help the design of module's interface).
* Guido: try a simple GUI (PySide), start experimenting, prepare canvas.


### Week 2

* Share info between groups
* Stabilize the module; because from now on all devels will have to use it.

* Guido: make an usable GUI
* Aisha: Implement the random-AI and cheater-AI
* Cliona and Electra: play a few games. Design a way to replay games (test-suite). Keep track of score, so that Aisha has someone to compete against.
